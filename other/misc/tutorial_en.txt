Did you know that you can predict what an MLP blind bag will contain without opening it?
We'll teach you all about it in this tutorial!

Step 1: First you need to know which wave of blind bag you see in a store. In this app you can see which bag matches the one in your store.

Step 2: Find the code on the blind bag (examples below):
- Wave 1-7 blind bags have a seam on the back of the blind bag with a code, this code is either 2 or 5 numbers long. When you have a 5-number code, only read the 2nd and 4th number: #80216 is #01 and #82206 is #20.
- Wave 8-11 blind bags have a 2-letter code on the bottom of the bag.

Step 3: Use this app to see which pony of the selected wave matches the code!

Here are 2 examples:
